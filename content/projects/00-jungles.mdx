Content Management System  
**2012**

While working on content websites, I found myself frustrated with with platforms like Drupal, Wordpress, and Umbraco. Having experience with Django and Ruby on Rails, where files and models are the backbone of the application, I decided to create a CMS that followed a similar approach. Rather than dealing with never-ending admin panels and storing all the configuration in a database, I opted for a setup where I could adjust everything through files, version control them and then deploy to a PAAS.
