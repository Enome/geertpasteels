Gardening Calendar  
**2014**

To improve my front-end application development skills I needed a side project. I settled on a calendar application for gardening.  Initially, I used AngularJS, but soon encountered performance issues. This led me to explore React.js, which was fairly new at the time. During discussions with React.js developers on IRC, they asked if they could showcase it on their [blog](https://tr.legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2014/02/24/community-roundup-17.html#sproutsheet).
