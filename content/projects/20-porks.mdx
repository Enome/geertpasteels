Invoicing application  
**2023 - 2024**

A personal project to get more familiar with TypeScript and some of the newer frameworks & technologies. Throughout the UX/Design phase, my aim was to create a focused UI, steering clear of the excess features often present in other invoice applications.

On the technical side, I wanted to have a strongly typed API so that it could be used on both the front-end and back-end.

The project began with NextJS, Remix, and gRPC, eventually settling on a SPA with AdonisJS with and React.js. An OpenAPI specification was created and used for integration tests and generated the types for the front- end.

The project is self-hosted on my home server as a docker container managed by Portainer with Traefic as the reverse proxy.
